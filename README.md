# MAD 1 Project - The Community Library
This was the project work under the MAD 1 coursework @ IIT Madras.
<br /><br />

It is a multi-user eBook platform developed using
the following technologies:

- SQLite for data storage
<br />


To setup the project locally:
- navigate to the Code directory
- create a ```.env``` file and add ```SECRET_KEY = any_random_value``` to the file and save it
- Open any terminal in this path, then,
  - type ```sh local_setup.sh``` to run the ```local_setup``` shell script and follow the instructions to setup the virtual environment and install the dependencies 
  - type ```sh local_run.sh``` to run the ```local_run``` shell script and follow the instructions to initiate a local run on your machine
- head over to the port 5551 of your localhost to explore the project
